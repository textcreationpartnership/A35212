            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Iſland of <hi>Brittain</hi> is of all others the moſt famous, and has been accounted the greateſt in the World; it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth all thoſe Iſlands both great and leſs, which lie in compaſs about it, the length thereof from South to North (that is from <hi>Lyſard</hi> Point in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> to the North of <hi>Scotland</hi>) is 624 miles, and the breadth thereof from the Lands end in <hi>Cornwall</hi> to the Iſle of <hi>Thanet</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> about 300 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles; It is a Country always very temperate, and was highly eſteemed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> as appears by what hath been ſaid concerning it, by one of their Orators, who calls it, the happy and moſt fortunate Iſland, endued by nature with all the bleſſings of Heaven and Earth, in that therein is neither extream cold in Winter, nor ſcorching heats in Summer, and that which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, <hi>long daies, and very lightſome nights;</hi> wherein there is ſuch an abundance of Grain, as may ſuffice both for Bread and Wine; the Woods thereof are without wild Beaſts, the Fields without noyſom Serpents, but therein are vaſt numbers of Milch Beaſts, and Sheep weighed down with their own Fleeces.

            <p>Upon <hi>Midſummer</hi> Eve, 1626. a Codfiſh was brought to the Market in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and there cut up for Sale, and in the Maw thereof there was found a Book in Twelves, bound up in Canvas, containing ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of Mr. <hi>John Friths;</hi> this Fiſh was caught upon the Coaſts of <hi>Lin,</hi> called <hi>Lindeeps,</hi> by one <hi>William Skinner;</hi> the Fiſh bei g cut open, the Garbidge was thrown by, which a Woman looking upon, eſpied the Canvas, and taking it out, found the Book wrapped up in it, which was much ſoiled, and covered over with a kind of ſlime, and congealed matter; this was looked upon with great admiration, and by <hi>Benjamin Prime,</hi> the the Batchelors Beadle, who was preſent at the opening of the Fiſh, was carried to the Vice-Chancellor, who took ſpecial notice of it, examining the particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; the leaves of the Book were carefully opened and cleanſed, the Treatiſes contained in it were, <hi>A Preparation for the Croſs, a Preparation for Death, the Treaſure of Knowledge; a Mirrour or Looking-glaſs to know themſelves by; a brief Inſtruction to teach one willingly to die, and not to fear death;</hi> they were all re-printed, and how uſeful the reviving of theſe Treatiſes by ſuch a ſpecial Providence hath been, may be eaſily diſcerned by ſuch as have lived ſince theſe times. In the Year 1640. a Pond in <hi>Cambridge</hi> became red as Blood, the water whereof being taken up in Baſons, remained ſtill of the ſame colour, and many ſtrange ſights were ſeen in the Air, as Armies fighting againſt each other, which were lookt on as ſad Preſages of our enſuing Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>

               <hi>Ely</hi> another City in this County, was formerly a place very famous for a Nunnery there founded by <hi>Audrey,</hi> Wife to one <hi>Tombret</hi> a Prince in this Province, who had this place as a part of her Dowry, and ſhe after his death Marrying with a King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in a ſhort time left her Huſband and the Rights of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,

and according to the Superſtition of thoſe dark times, built this Monaſtery, and became her ſelf firſt Abbeſs thereof; this in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Deſolations was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but ſoon after re-built by <hi>Ethelwold,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who ſtored it with Monks, to whom K. <hi>Edgar</hi> granted the Juriſdiction over four Hundreds and an half within theſe Fenns, which to this day are called <hi>The Liberties of St.</hi> Audrey; after whoſe example ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nobles ſo inriched it with Revenues, that the Abbot thereof laid up yearly in his own Coffers 1400 pounds; and ſoon after the Monks thereof repaired their old Church with new and ſtately buildings, which now is the Cathedral of the Dioceſs, and for beauty gives place to no other in the Land; <hi>Ely</hi> Minſter preſenteth itſelf afar off to the Eye of the Traveller, and on all ſides at a great diſtance not only promiſeth, but giveth earneſt of the magnificence thereof; the Lanthorn therein built by Biſhop <hi>Hotham,</hi> (wherein the labour of Twenty Years, and Five Thouſand ninety four pounds, eighteen Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ten pence half penny farthing was expended) is a Maſter-piece of Architecture; when the Bells ring, the Wood-work thereof ſhaketh and gapeth (which is no defect but the perfection of Architecture) and exactly falleth into the joints again; rare alſo is the Art in the Chappel of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and the other of Biſhop <hi>Weſt,</hi> wherein the Maſter Maſons in King <hi>James</hi> his time, on ſerious inſpection ſound finer Stonework than in K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 7.

            <p>In 1190. K. <hi>Richard</hi> 1. went into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and at his going left in chief place of Authority at home <hi>William Longſhamp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who carried himſelf ſo, that though the things he did were juſtifiable, yet the pride wherewith they were done was unſufferable, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom riding abroad without 500 or a 1000 Men in his Train, not for ſafety, but for State, and though others were left in power beſides, yet he made but Ciphers of them, ruling all as he pleaſed; this inſolency was inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, ſo that ſome holding for, and others againſt him the Kingdom was in danger to be rent in ſunder, till at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57811:15"/>
laſt the Biſhop finding himſelf too weak for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, thought it beſt to fly out of the Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon for his greater ſafety diſguiſing himſelf in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Apparel, and carrying a piece of Linnen Cloath under his Arm, he deſigned in this manner to take Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and go beyond Sea; but being diſcovered, and known, the Women in revenge of the abuſe done to their Cloths in making them the inſtruments of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, fell upon him, and beat him ſo, that it might have beaten Humility into him for ever after; this diſgrace made him glad to get into <hi>France</hi> his Native Country, where to little purpoſe he woed the King and Queen for Reparation.</p>

tall Oaks, and certain other ſmall Trees, and not a ſprig of them to be ſeen above water; four or five Oaks more were expected to fall every moment, and a great quantity of Land beſide, it never ceaſing more or leſs, and when any conſiderable clod fell it was much like the report of a Canon; we could diſcern the ground hollow above the water a great way, but how far, or how deep is, not to be found out by man; the water was ſalt, like that of the Sea, from whence ſome imagine it came through cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain large paſſages under ground, but it is probable to be no other than that which iſſues from thoſe ſalt Springs about <hi>Nantwich,</hi> and other places in this County; may we not alſo judge that thoſe Trees which are digged up in ſome places hereabout were buried in the Earth by ſome ſuch accident as this is?</p>

               <hi>July</hi> 30. 1662 was a very ſtormy and Tempeſtuous day in many parts of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> at <hi>Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi> there was ſuch a ſtorm of hail, as brake the Glaſs-windows, and did much hurt to their Corn; Mr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> meaſured an Hailſtone after ſome of it was waſted, and found it four inches about, others being thought larger; the ſame day in the afternoon in the Forreſt of <hi>Maxfeild</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> there aroſe a great Pillar of ſmoke, in height like a Steeple, and judg'd 20 yards broad, which making a moſt hideous noiſe, went along the ground 6 or 7 miles, levelling all in the way; it threw down Fences and Stonewalls, and carried the Stones a great diſtance from their places, but happening upon Mooriſh ground not inhabited, it did the leſs hurt, the terrible noiſe it made ſo affrighted the Cattel, that they ran away, and were thereby preſerved; it paſſed over a Cornfield, and laid all as even with the ground as if it had been troden down with Feet; it went through a Wood, and turned up above an hundred Trees by the Roots; coming into a Field full of Cocks of Hay ready to be carried in, it ſwept all away, ſo that ſcarce an handful of it could afterward be found, only it left a great Tree behind in the middle of the Field, which it had brought from ſome other place; from the Forreſt

            <p>Dr. <hi>Walter Needham,</hi> an eminent and learned Phyſician in a late diſcourſe of Anatomy, gives a Relation of a Child that cryed in its Mothers Womb, which is as followeth; A long time (ſaith he) I could ſcarce believe that there were ſuch cryings, till I was informed of that which I now ſet down by a Noble Lady in <hi>Cheſhire;</hi> as this Honourable Perſon ſate after meat in the Dining Room with her Huſband, their Domeſtick Chaplain, and divers others, ſhe was ſenſible of an extraordinary ſtirring in her Belly, which ſo lift up her cloths, that it it was eaſily diſcernable to thoſe that were preſent (ſhe was then with Child, and in her ſeventh month) upon a ſuddain there was a voice heard, but whence it ſhould come they were not able to conjecture, not ſuſpecting any thing of the <hi>Embrio</hi> in her Womb, ſoon after they perceived the Belly and Garments of the Lady to have a ſecond and notable commotion, and withal heard a cry as if it proceeded from thence; while they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at what had paſſed, and were diſcourſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Prodigy, all that before had happened, did a third time ſo manifeſtly appear, that (being now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more attentive) they doubted not but that the cry came from her Womb; the Girl that was ſo talkative in the Womb of her Mother doth yet live, and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough ſo to continue; I cannot doubt, ſaith he, of the Truth of ſo eminent a ſtory, receiving the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it from ſo credible Perſons.</p>

but if we believe reports, there is a more eaſy way, and that is by Dreams, by which it's ſaid, works of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue have been found; as in K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6th time, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman (Heireſs to one <hi>Titſculiard</hi>) dreamed, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome man told her, that in ſuch a Tenement of her Land ſhe ſhould find Tinn enough to inrich her ſelf and her poſterity; who telling her Huſband, upon Tryal he found a Tinnwork there, which in 4 years was worth to him almoſt 4000 pounds; it is ſaid likewiſe that one <hi>Taprel</hi> of St. <hi>Niot,</hi> by a dream of his Daughters was wiſhed to ſuch a place, which he farmed of the Lord of the Soil, and found a Tinnwork accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, which made him a rich man; which Stories if true make much for the credit of Womens dreams. From the bottom of the Tinn-works if they be of any depth, you may ſee the Stars at noon-day in clear wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the labour is ſo hard, and tedious, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work above 4 hours in a day, they ſometimes meet with looſe earth, yet otherwhile they light upon ſuch hard Rocks, that a good workman can ſcarce hew above a foot in a week; ſometimes again they meet with great ſtreams of water, and ſometimes with ſtinking damps that diſtemper their heads for the preſent, though not dangerouſly; I hear of no Medicinal Water in this Countrey, but only one, and ſince he that telleth a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous truth, muſt always carry the Author at his back (ſaith my Author) I will tranſcribe the words of B. <hi>Hall</hi> in his <hi>Myſt. of Godlineſs,</hi> ſpeaking of the good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Angels to Gods Servants; <hi>Of this kind,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was that no leſs than miraculous cure which at St.</hi> Maderns <hi>in</hi> Cornwall, <hi>was wrought upon a poor Cripple, whereof beſides the atteſtation of many Hundreds of the Neighbours, I took a ſtrict and impartial examination in my laſt Viſitation; this man for</hi> 16 <hi>years together was fain to walk upon his hands, by reaſon the ſinews of his legs were ſo contracted, and upon Monitions in his dream to waſh in that Well, was ſuddenly ſo reſtored to his Limbs, that I ſaw him able both to walk, and get his own maintenance, I found here was neither Art nor Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion the thing done, the Inviſible Author being God.</hi>

from them, though ſtrongly defended, their Arrows being reported to be a full yard in length, and aſſaulting them every way, killed 2000, and took many Priſoners, divers of whom the King pardoned, but none of the Leaders; the L. <hi>Audly</hi> was drawn from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Hill</hi> in a Coat of his own Arms drawn upon Paper, reverſed, and all torn, and there beheaded; <hi>Thomas Flammock</hi> and <hi>Michael Joſeph</hi> were drawn, hang'd and quartered, and their quarters ſet upon ſtakes.

            <p>They were likewiſe guilty of another Rebellion in the 2. of K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6, 1549. for injunctions being ſent forth by that pious Prince for removing Images out of Churches, and that the Miniſters ſhould diſſuade the People from praying to Saints, for for the dead, from uſe of Beeds, Aſhes, and Proceſſions, from Maſſes Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, praying in an unknown Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners went abroad to ſee them executed, Mr. <hi>Body</hi> a Commiſſioner as he was pulling down Images in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> was ſuddenly ſtabbed with a knife into the body by a Popiſh Prieſt; hereupon the People flockt together from ſeveral parts of this Shire, and taking Arms, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted divers outrages, as they did alſo in ſeveral other Counties; theſe Religious Mutineers ſent ſeveral Articles to the King, and among other things required to have the <hi>Latine</hi> Maſs again, and the ſix Articles in K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. time (called the bloody Articles) revived again; now though the King knew reaſons would little prevail with unreaſonable men, yet he ſent them anſwers in writing, and a general Pardon if they would deſiſt, and lay down their Arms; the anſwer about the 6 Articles is worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing; <hi>You require,</hi> ſaith the King, <hi>to have the Statute of the</hi> 6 <hi>Articles revived, do you know what you ask?

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57811:22"/>
Laws were indeed made, but as ſoon repented of, for they were too cruel and bloody to be endured by our People; oh poor Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Subjects, how are you inſnared and deceived by ſubtle Traitors? We out of pity took them away, beeauſe they were bloody, and you out of Ignorance deſire them again, you know full well they made us to be cruel and ſevere, and gave us cauſe to draw our Sword very often; they were like a whetſtone to our Sword, and for your ſakes only we left off to uſe them; and ſince our mercy inclineth us to write our Laws in Milk and Equity, how come you to be ſo blinded as to deſire they ſhould be writ in blood? But aſſure your ſelves and be confident, that we make account of nothing under Heaven ſo much as this, to have our Laws obeyed, and this cauſe of God which we have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be throughly maintained, from which we will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a hairs breadth, nor give place to any Creature living, much leſs to any Subject, but therein we will venture our own Royal Perſon, our Crown, Treaſure, Realm, and all our Eſtate, whereof we aſſure you of our high honour; and as to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer which you are againſt, it cannot certainly offend any reaſonable man that the ſervice of God is changed from an unknown Tongue, ſince it is only to make him underſtand what before he knew not, and thereby to give his conſent to thoſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which he hath moſt need of, and to affect his Conſcience therewith, ſince God requireth the heart only, and that we ſhould offer a reaſonable Service to him.</hi> He concludes; <hi>We for our parts deſire to live no longer than to be a Father to our People, and as God hath made us your Rightful King, ſo hath he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to be obedient, by whoſe great Majeſty we ſolemnly proteſt, you ſhall feel the Power of the ſame God in our Sword, which how mighty it is, no Subject knoweth, how puiſſant no private man can judge, and how mortal no</hi> Engliſh <hi>heart can think; therefore imbrace our Mercy while it is offered, leſt the blood ſpilt by your means cry for vengeance from the Earth, and be heard in the ears of the Lord in Heaven.</hi> But the Rebels grew ſtill more outragious, coming before the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and demanding entrance; which being refuſed, they endeavoured to take it by ſtorm, and firing the Gates, and Mining, but all in vain, yet they lay ſo long before it, that the Citizens within ſuffered great want of

Victuals, making bread of the courfeſt bran, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Horſefleſh, in which extremity an aged Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen bringing forth all his Proviſions to the People, told them, <hi>That as he communicated to them his ſtore, ſo he would partake with them in their wants, and that he would feed upon one Arm, and fight with the other before he would conſent to put the City into the hands of the Seditious;</hi> but the L. <hi>Grey,</hi> and the L. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> after many conflicts with the Rebels forced them to raiſe the Seige, and utterly routed them; the Sedition being thus ſuppreſſed, it is memorable what cruel ſport Sir <hi>William Kingſton</hi> the Provoſt Marſhal made, by virtue of his Office upon men in miſery; one <hi>Boyer</hi> Mayor of <hi>Bodmin</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi> had been amongſt the Rebels, not willingly, but inforced; to him the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt ſent word he would come and dine with him, for whom the Mayor made great Proviſion; a little before Dinner the Provoſt took the Mayor aſide, and whiſpered him in the ear, <hi>That an Execution muſt be that day done in the Town,</hi> and therefore required to have a pair of Gallows ſet up againſt Dinner was done; the Mayor provided them accordingly, preſently after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Provoſt taking the Mayor by the hand, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to ſhew him the place where the Gallows was, which when he beheld, he asked the Mayor, if he thought them to be ſtrong enough; <hi>yes,</hi> ſaid the Mayor, <hi>doubtleſs they are; well then,</hi> ſaid the Provoſt, <hi>get you up ſpeedily for they are provided for you: I hope,</hi> ſaid the Mayor, <hi>you do not mean as you ſpeak; In faith,</hi> ſaies the Provoſt, <hi>there is no Remedy, for you have been a buſie Rebel;</hi> and ſo without reſpite or defence he was hanged to death; a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous part for a Gueſt to offer his Hoſt. Near the ſame place dwelt a Miller that had been very active in that Rebellion; who fearing the approach of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, told a ſturdy Fellow his Servant, that he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to go from home, and if any man ſhould inquire for the Miller, he bid him ſay, that himſelf was the Miller, and had been ſo for 3 years before; ſoon after the Provoſt came, and called for the Miller, when out comes the Servant, and ſaid he was the man, the Provoſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57811:23"/>
demanded how long he had kept the Mill: <hi>Theſe</hi> 3 <hi>years,</hi> anſwered the Servant; the Provoſt then commanded his men to lay hold of him, and hang him on the next Tree; at this the Fellow cried out, <hi>That he was not the Miller, but the Millers Man; Nay Sir,</hi> ſaid the Provoſt, <hi>I will take you at your word, and if thou beeſt the Miller, thou art a buſie Knave; if thou beeſt not, thou art a falſe lying Knave, and however thou canſt never do thy Maſter better ſervice than to hang for him,</hi> and ſo without more ado he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched.</p>
            <p>I will conclude the Remarks of this County with ſomewhat more Comical. At the Diſſolution of Abbeys K. <hi>Ken.</hi> 8. gave away large ſhares to almoſt every one that aſked: Amongſt other Inſtances take this merry ſtory. It happened that two or three Gentlemen, the Kings ſervants, waited at the door, where the King was to come out, with a deſign to beg a large parcel of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Lands; One Mr. <hi>John Champernoun,</hi> another of his ſervants, ſeeing them, was very inquiſitive to know their ſuit, but they would not impart it to him; in the mean time out comes the King, they kneel down, ſo doth <hi>Champernoun,</hi> (being aſſured by an implicit Faith that Courtiers beg nothing hurtful to themſelves) they preſent their Petition, the King grants it, they render him humble thanks, ſo doth Mr. <hi>Champernoun;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he requires his ſhare; they deny it; he appeals to the King, who avows, <hi>that he meant they ſhould have equal ſhares;</hi> whereupon his Companions were forced to allot him the Priory of St. <hi>German</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> valued at 243 pound a Year; ſo that a dumb Beggar met with a blind Giver, the one as little knowing what he aſked as the other what he gave.

            <p>Sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi> was born of a worthy and ancient Family at <hi>Riſely</hi> in this County; In the Reign of K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 6. he was imployed by the King and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>London</hi> to find out the <hi>North Eaſt paſſage</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> having three Ships provided for that purpoſe with a large Commiſſion, which did not bear date from the Year of our Lord, but from the Year of the World 5515, becauſe in their long Voyage they might have occaſion to preſent it to foreign Princes: They depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Deptford May</hi> 10. 1553, and after much fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>Hugh,</hi> and moſt of his company, were then in health, though all ſoon after frozen to death in a River or Haven, called <hi>Arzina</hi> in <hi>Lapland:</hi> The next Summer ſome other Engliſh Ships coming to the ſame place, found the Ship intire, and all the men frozen to death, with a particular account of all the paſſages of their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. <hi>Lapland</hi> hath ſeveral times ſince been ſurrounded by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Weſt part whereof belongeth to the K. of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the Eaſt to the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Heathens, as poor in Knowledge as Eſtate, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Tribute in Furs, whoſe little houſes are but great holes, wherein they generally live in the Ignorance of Money. Here let me inſert a paſſage to refreſh the Reader after this ſad ſtory: There is a cuſtom in this barbarous Country, (as credible Merchants, who have been Eye-witneſſes, report) that it is death to marry a maid without her Parents and Friends conſent; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any man have an affection for a Maid, a day is appointed for both of their Friends to meet, and ſee the young couple run a Race; the Maid hath the advantage of ſtarting, and a third part of the Race, ſo that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, except ſhe be willing her ſelf, ſhe ſhould ever be overtaken; if the Maid outrun her Sweet-heart the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is ended, he muſt never have her, nor make any further motion to her under a great penalty; but if the Virgin have any affection for him, though ſhe at firſt may run hard to try the truth of his Love, yet ſhe will pretend to ſtumble, or make a voluntary halt, before ſhe comes to the end of the Race, ſo that he may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her: Thus none are compelled to marry againſt their Wills, which is the cauſe that in this poor Country the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57811:27"/>
married People are richer in their own content than in other Lands, where ſo many forced matches make feigned Love and cauſe real unhappineſs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1660, about <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> it rained white Aſhes, which fell in ſuch quantities, that ſeveral Fields lookt white as if Snow had covered them. The ſame Year, <hi>Nov.</hi> 20. the River <hi>Derwent</hi> was at <hi>Derby,</hi> and 5 Miles above, and 5 Miles below that Town, for 3 or 4 hours totally dried up, ſo that no water during that time came to any of the Mills upon the River; the Boats were all on ground, and the Fiſhes upon the Sand, ſo that the Children took them up in their hands, and in ſeveral places the people went over the Channel dryſhod, which is more remarkable, becauſe <hi>Derwent</hi> is an inland River, and never ebbs or flows, and it is at <hi>Derby</hi> generally an 100 Foot broad, and 7 or 8 Foot deep, and is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary quick, fierce ſtream.

that would not ſtand or ſpeak, he ſhould not fail to kill him whoſoever he were.</hi> Having thus provided, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to end his doleful Days, he in a dark night conveyed himſelf ſecretly out of his houſe, and walked alone in his Park; the Keeper in his Circuit hearing one ſtirring and coming toward him, aſked, who was there, but no anſwer being made, he commanded him to ſtand, which when he would not do, the Keeper ſhot him dead, and coming to ſee who it was, found it to be his Maſter.

One Maſter <hi>Hill</hi> had his head ſuddenly ſtruck againſt the Wall in his ſeat, with ſuch violence, that he dyed the ſame night, no other hurt being obſerved, his Son ſitting by him received no hurt; at the ſame Inſtance another man had his Head cloven, his Skull rent into 3 pieces, and his Brains thrown upon the ground whole, the Hair of his Head, through the violence of the blow, ſtuck faſt to a Pillar near him; ſome Seats in the Body of the Church were turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down, yet thoſe which ſate in them had little or no hurt: One man going out of the Chancel door, his Dog ran before him, who was whirled about toward the door, and fell down ſtark dead, upon which the Maſter ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped back, and was preſerved: The Church itſelf was much torn and defaced with the Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a Beam whereof breaking in the midſt, fell down between the Miniſter and Clark, and hurt neither; the Steeple was much rent, and it was obſerved where the Church was moſt rent, there the leaſt hurt was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People; there were none hurt with the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or Stones, but one Maid, who it was judged was killed by the falling of a Stone, which might eaſily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, ſince Stones were thrown down from the Steeple as faſt as if it had been by an 100 Men: A Pinnacle of the Tower being thrown down, beat through into the Church; The Pillar againſt which the Pulpit ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly whited was turned black and ſulphury; there were in all 3 perſons killed, and 62 hurt, divers of them having their Linnen burnt, though their outward Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not ſo much as ſinged; The Lightning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt, and the People in a terrible Maze, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

            <p>In the Reign of K. <hi>Edward</hi> 2 the great Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> married a Lady from <hi>Camford</hi> in this County, who was taken out of his houſe by one <hi>Richard Martin</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed lame Dwarf, who challenged her for his Wife, alledging he had lain with her before the Earl married her, whereupon the Lady was examined, who volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily confeſſed it was all true, and thereupon the ugly Fellow in her right claimed the Two Earldoms of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> and <hi>Salisbury.</hi> In the Fourth of this Kings Reign the Church of <hi>Middleton,</hi> with all the Monuments, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with Lightning, the Monks being at Mattens.

            <p>In 1506. King <hi>Philip</hi> ſailing out of <hi>Germany</hi> to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> was driven by Tempeſt upon the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> and landed at <hi>Weymouth</hi> to refreſh himſelf, and was invited by Sir <hi>Tho.

hair-brain'd Fellow the Earl of</hi> Suffolk, <hi>who being my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is protected in your Country, and begins to play the Fool when all others are weary of it.</hi> The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I had thought Sir your felicity had been above theſe thoughts; but if it trouble you I will baniſh him.</hi> K. <hi>Henry</hi> anſwered, <hi>That his deſire was to have him delivered to him;</hi> with this the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> a little confuſed, ſaid, <hi>That can I not do with my honour: Well then,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>the matter is at an end;</hi> at laſt the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> who much eſteemed K. <hi>Henry,</hi> compoſing his Countenance, ſaid, <hi>Sir, you ſhall have him; but upon your honour you ſhall not take his Life: I promiſe it upon my honour,</hi> ſaid K. <hi>Henry;</hi> and he kept his promiſe, for he was not put to death du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all his Reign; but yet he took ſuch order, that in the Reign of his Son K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. he had his Head cut off. This Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> had lately gone over to <hi>Flanders</hi> to the Lady <hi>Margret,</hi> K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s ſworn Enemy, which made the King doubt of his Intentions: The Earl was accordingly brought over, and ſent to the Tower, and after K. <hi>Philip</hi> had received the Order of the Garter, and Prince <hi>Henry</hi> that of the Golden Fleece, the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> departed home.</p>
            <p>In the 26. of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1558. at a place called <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Armitage,</hi> in this County, a piece of ground containing 3 Acres, removed from its place, and went quite over another Cloſe, with the Trees and Fences thereon, a great way off, ſtopping up an High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way which led to <hi>Cerne,</hi> the ſame Hedges incloſing it as before, and the Trees ſtanding very upright thereon, onely one Oak of almoſt 20 Load fell down; in the place from whence it removed there remained a great deep Pit. In 1613. <hi>Aug.</hi> 7. The Town of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> was utterly conſumed with Fire, which began in the houſe of a Tallow-Chandler, and deſtroyed the whole Town, ſave a few Houſes near the Church, and all their Wares and Goods, to the value of Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, yet no man periſhed therein. In <hi>June,</hi> 1653. a black Cloud was ſeen over the Town of <hi>Pool,</hi> and ſoon after diſſolved into a ſhower of Blood, which

fell warm upon mens hands, ſome green leaves with thoſe drops upon them were ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and ſeen by many. The Forreſt of the <hi>White Hart</hi> is in this County, ſo called, becauſe in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. the King came hither to hunt, and having taken other Deer, he ſpared a moſt beautiful and goodly white Heart, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Thomas de Lynd</hi> a Gentleman of this Country with others in his Company took and killed, for which the King put a mulct or Fine upon him, and the whole County, and the very lands which they held, pay even to this day every year by way of amercement a ſum of Mony into the Exchequer, which is called <hi>White Hart Silver; My ſelf,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Fuller, have paid a ſhare for the ſauce, who never taſted any of the meat, ſo that it ſeems Kings Veniſon is ſooner eaten than digeſted.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Ignatius Jordan</hi> was born at <hi>Lime Regis</hi> in this County; and when he was young, was ſent to <hi>Exeter,</hi> to be brought up a Merchant; in this City having paſſed through the ſeveral inferiour Offices, he at laſt came to be Mayor, and was a Juſtice of Peace 24 years together; yet his beginning was but very mean, which he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to acknowledg for when ſome threatned him with Law-ſuits, and <hi>that they would not give over while he was worth a groat,</hi> he cheerfully told them, <hi>That he ſhould be then but two pence poorer, than when he came firſt to</hi> Exeter, <hi>for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I brought but ſix pence with me hither;</hi> He would often ſay, <hi>He wondred what rich men meant, that they gave ſo little to the Poor, and yet raked ſo much together for their Children; do you not ſee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what becomes of it?</hi> and would reckon up divers examples of ſuch as heaped up much for their Children, and they in a ſhort time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed it all; on the other ſide, he ſpoke of ſuch as had ſmall beginnings, and afterward became rich, or of a competent Eſtate, giving a particular inſtance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>I came,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but with a groat or ſixpence in my purſe to this City, had I had a ſhilling in my purſe, I had never been Mayor of</hi> Exeter. In his Troubles in the Star Chamber, when one told him, <hi>he was ſorry that the Lord Keeper was againſt him;</hi> He anſwered, <hi>I have a greater Lord Keeper than

him, the Lord is my Keeper, I will not be afraid,</hi> He was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Juſtice and Charity in his life, and at his death left very large Legacies to the poor, both of that City and County; he died in 1640.</p>

For on <hi>Chriſtmas day</hi> ſay our Chronicles at <hi>Oxenhall,</hi> which is this place, the ground heaved up aloft like a Tower, and ſo continued all that day, as it were immoveable, till evening, and then fell with ſo horrible a noiſe, that it affrighted the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereabout, and the Earth ſwallowing it up, made in the ſame place three deep Pits; it is reported that Biſhop <hi>Tonſtall</hi> put a Gooſe into one of theſe Pits, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt given her a mark, and the ſame Gooſe was found in the River <hi>Tees,</hi> which if true, theſe Kettles have paſſages under ground; within the River <hi>Weer</hi> at <hi>Butterby</hi> near <hi>Durham,</hi> in Summer Time their iſſues a ſalt reddiſh water, which the Sun makes white, and growing thick becomes Salt, which the People thereabout always uſe.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, one <hi>Wolſtan</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> whom upon <hi>Lanfranks</hi> reporting to be inſufficient for the place, for want of Learning, the King commanded to put off his Pontifical Robes, and to leave his Biſhoprick, when ſuddenly out of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, ſaith our Hiſtorian, <hi>Wolſton</hi> anſwered, <hi>A better

            <p>When K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. was Victorious in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> with <hi>David Bruce</hi> their King (by the incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>French</hi> King) invade <hi>England</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Threeſcore and two Thouſand Men, and marched as far as <hi>Durham,</hi> ſuppoſing that none but Prieſts and Shepheards, were left at home, becauſe ſuch a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were abroad upon Service; but they found it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for the Lords in the North, as <hi>Gilbert <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mfrevile,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Angus, Henry Piercy, Ralph Nevil, William Dayncourt,</hi> with the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and others of the Clergy, gathered ſuch great Forces, and ordered them ſo well, that by the anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Queen <hi>Philip,</hi> who though big with Child, rode in Perſon through the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops, and with wiſe and gracious words incouraged them, that they obtained a very ſignal Victory; for meeting the Scots at <hi>Nevils</hi> Croſs in this Biſhoprick, they utterly defeated their great Army, and took <hi>David</hi> their King Priſoner, with the Earls of <hi>Fife, Menteith, Murray, Sutherland, Dowglas,</hi> the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and others, and ſlew fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand <hi>Scots;</hi> who yet could not be charged for want of valour, eſpecially the King himſelf, who had two Spears hanging in his body, his leg deſperately wounded with an Arrow, his Sword and other weapons beaten out of his hand; and yet diſdaining to be taken Captive, endeavoured by provoking language to induce the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to kill him, and therefore when one <hi>John Copland,</hi> Captain of <hi>Roxborough</hi> Caſtle, adviſed him to yeild, the King ſtruck him ſo fiercely over the face with his Gauntlet, as beat out two of his Teeth; but ſince he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57811:35"/>
could not force a death, he muſt ſubmit to be a Priſoner, and was conveyed by <hi>Copland,</hi> and eight of his Servants out of the Field; the Queen retired to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the event of the Battle, and underſtanding that K. <hi>David</hi> was taken, ſhe ſent Letters to the Captain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up his Royal Priſoner, which he refuſing, ſhe ſends over a complaint to K. <hi>Edward;</hi> who ordered him to come to <hi>Calice,</hi> where he made ſo diſcreet a defence, that he was ſent back, and had 500 pound a year in Land given him in any place which he ſhould chuſe near his own dwelling, with order to deliver up his Priſoner to the Queen, which he did accordingly at <hi>York</hi> with ſuch a modeſt and ingenious Apology, as ſatisfied both the Queen and the Lords of the Council.

and her Uncle K. <hi>Edward;</hi> he then preferred her two Brothers, <hi>William Peveril</hi> to be Keeper of <hi>Dover Caſtle,</hi> and <hi>Pain Peveril</hi> he made Baron of <hi>Bourn</hi> in <hi>Cambridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> having thus preferred her Kindred, he began to ſollicite her by the Meſſengers of the Devils Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is, ſubtil inſinuating Pimps, and Bawds, and ſometimes he himſelf viſited her (like <hi>Jupiter</hi>) in a golden ſhower, by theſe forceable demonſtrations of love, and unavoidable allurements (eſpecially from a King) ſhe was at length brought to his unlawful Bed, unto whom ſhe bore a Son, named <hi>William,</hi> who was Lord of <hi>Nottingham;</hi> but his Mother being afterward touched with remorſe of Conſcience, to expiate her guilt, was taught by the Doctrine of thoſe times to found a Colledge in the Village of <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the honour of God, and St. <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> wherein ſetting apart all worldly affairs, ſhe ſpent the remainder of her days, and died about the year 1100.</p>

            <p>There were no leſs than forty four Perſons who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Martyrdom for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; among whom was <hi>William Hunter</hi> a young man of 19 years old, born of religious Parents, who inſtructed him in the Truth, and ſent him to be an Apprentice in <hi>London,</hi> where refuſing to go to Maſs, and receive the Sacrament, he went home to his Parents at <hi>Burntwood,</hi> and one day going into a Chappel there, he found a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which while he was reading, a Summoner came in, and asked him whether he could expound the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he anſwered, <hi>He did only read it to his Comfort;</hi> the Sumner replied, <hi>It was never a merry world ſince the Bible came forth in</hi> Engliſh; <hi>Hunter</hi> anſwered, <hi>Say not ſo for Gods ſake, for it is Gods Book, out of which every one ought to learn how to pleaſe God, and therefore I pray God that we may have the Bleſſed Bible amongſt us; Ay</hi> ſaid the Sumner, <hi>I know your mind well enough, you are one of thoſe that do not like the Queens Laws; but you and many more muſt turn over a new leaf, or you will broil for it; pray God give me grace,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hunter, that I may believe his word, and confeſs his name whatever comes of it; Nay,</hi> ſaid the Sumner, <hi>you confeſs the Devils name, and will all go to him;</hi> The Sumner then fetcht a Prieſt out of a blind Alehouſe, who finding <hi>Hunter</hi> reading, reviled him for it, and then asked him what he thought of the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, whether there were not really Chriſts Body and Blood; <hi>Hunter</hi> ſaid, <hi>He found no ſuch thing in Scripture; ah,</hi> quoth the Vicar, <hi>now I find you are an Heretick; Hunter</hi> replyed, <hi>Would you and I were both tyed to a Stake to try whether of us would ſtick cloſeſt to our Faith;</hi> The Prieſt left him, and informing againſt him, he was ſeized and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Biſhop <hi>Bonner,</hi> who finding that he ſtood firm to his Principles, cauſed his Officers to ſet him in the Stocks, in his <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> where he lay 2 days, and had nothing but a cruſt of brown bread, and a cup of cold water;

after Impriſonment three quarters of a Year, the Bp. condemned him, and ſent him to <hi>Burntwood</hi> to be burnt; where his Father and Mother came to him, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching God he might continue conſtant to the end:</hi> His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, <hi>ſhe was happy in bearing ſuch a Child, who could find in his heart to loſe his Life for Chriſt's ſake.</hi> At the ſtake he kneeled down, and read the 51ſt Pſalm; then the Sheriff ſaid to him, <hi>Here is a Letter from the Queen, if thou wilt recant thou ſhalt live, otherwiſe thou ſhalt be burnt: No,</hi> quoth <hi>William, I will never recant,</hi> and ſo he was faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſtake: He then ſaid, <hi>Good People, pray for me while you ſee me alive,</hi> adding, <hi>Son of God ſhine upon me:</hi> and the Sun immediately ſhone out of a thick Cloud ſo full in his face, that he was forced to turn his head aſide; fire being kindled he lift up his Hand to Heaven ſaying <hi>Lord, Lord, receive my Spirit,</hi> and ſo ended his Life in the Flames.</p>

               <hi>John Lawrence</hi> was burnt at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> whoſe Legs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lame with Irons, and his Body weak with cruel u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, he was carried to the Stake in a Chair, and burnt therein; at his burning many young Children being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fire, cried out to him, <hi>Lord ſtrengthen thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and keep thy Promiſe,</hi> which was lookt on as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Divine Providence, who <hi>out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings hath ordained ſtrength.

There was an Idol called the Rood of <hi>Dover-Court</hi> in this County, to which multitudes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple went in Pilgrimage: Divers zealous Proteſtants at <hi>Dedham</hi> being much troubled to ſee the Almighty ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by wicked Idolatry, went from thence in a Froſty Moonſhine Night 10 Miles to the place where
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57811:40"/>
the Idol was, where they found the Church Doors open, the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy boaſting the power of this Rood was ſuch, that no man could ſhut the doors of the Church where it ſtood: Theſe Perſons taking the Image from the place where it ſtood, carried it a quarter of a Mile off, and there burnt it to aſhes; for which three of them were by the bloody Papiſts hanged in Chains. In 1605. a great <hi>Porpus</hi> was taken at <hi>Weſtham</hi> in a little Creek alive, a Mile and half within the Land, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days after a Whale came up the <hi>Thames,</hi> whoſe lenght was ſeen divers times above Water, and judged to exceed the largeſt Ship in the River; but when ſhe taſted the Freſh-Water, and ſcented the Land, ſhe returned into the Sea.</p>

moſt of their Bellies, and when he had done, told his Lord how he had ſped; the Earl goes inſtantly to Court, tells the King that ſuch a Nunnery was become a Bawdy Houſe, procures a Viſitation, gets them turned out, and begs the Land for his own uſe.

               <hi>Southampton</hi> is a Town populous, rich and beautiful, from which the whole County derives its name; The famous King <hi>Canutus</hi> his flatterers perſuaded him that he was greater than <hi>Alexander, Caeſar, or Cyrus,</hi> and was poſſeſſed with more than humane Power; to convince theſe fawning Courtiers being one time at <hi>Southampton,</hi> he commanded his Chair of State ſhould be ſet on the ſhore when the Sea began to flow, and then ſitting down therein, in the preſence of many of his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants he ſpake thus to the Element, <hi>Thou Sea art part of my Dominion, and the ground whereon I ſit is mine, neither was there ever any that durſt diſobey my command, or by breaking it eſcaped unpuniſhed, I charge thee therefore that thou preſume not to come upon my Land, nor wet theſe Royal Robes of thy Lord that are about me,</hi> But the Sea giving no heed to his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but keeping on its uſual courſe of Tide, firſt wet his Skirts, and then his Thighs, whereupon ſuddenly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up, he thus ſpake in the hearing of them all; <hi>Let all the worlds Inhabitants know that vain and weak is the power of their Kings, and that none is worthy of the name of King, but he that keeps both Heaven, Earth, and Sea in obedience, and bindeth them in an everlaſting Law of Subjection.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which time he would never ſuffer the Crown to be ſet upon his head, but preſently crowned therewith the Picture of our Saviour on the Croſs at <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> with ſuch ſtrong deluſions were theſe devout Princes drawn away, by thoſe crafty Prieſts who alwaies made gain of their Godlineſs. This King after he had reigned 19 years in great glory, died at <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and was buried in the Church of the old <hi>Monaſtery</hi> at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to which Church he gave moſt Rich, and Royal Jewels, whereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57811:55"/>
this Hill with a Rock under it, made at firſt a mighty bellowing noiſe, which was heard a great way off, and then lifted up itſelf a great height, and began to travel, carrying along with it the Trees which grew upon it, the Sheepfolds, and flocks of Sheep abiding thereon at the ſame time; in the place from whence it firſt moved, it left a gaping diſtance 40 Foot wide, and 80 Ells long, the whole field was about Twenty Acres; paſſing along it overthrew a Chappel ſtanding in its way, removed an Ewe-tree growing in the Church-Yard from the Weſt to the Eaſt; with the like violence it thruſt before it Highways, Houſes, and Trees, it made <hi>tilled</hi> ground <hi>paſture,</hi> and again turned <hi>paſture</hi> into <hi>Tillage;</hi> having thus walked from <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Evening, till <hi>Monday</hi> Noon, it then ſtood ſtill, and moved no more, mounting to a Hill 12 Fathoms high.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>William the Conqueror, Walter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> attempted to force the Chaſtity of a Woman who was a Semſtreſs, whom out of pretence of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him he brought into his Chamber, but ſhe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to conſent, wounded him in the Belly with a pair of Sciſſars, whereof he died. In 1233. a little before the Wars broke forth between K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and his Barons, there appeared at <hi>Hereford</hi> five Suns at once, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Circle of a Chriſtal colour about two Foot in breadth, as it were compaſſing all <hi>England.</hi> In the Reign of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 1402. <hi>Owen Glendour</hi> being by the <hi>Welch</hi> made their King and Captain, having got together a conſiderable number, brake into the borders of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> making ſpoil and Prey of the Country, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if they had leave to do it, and indeed they had none to oppoſe them, but only the Lord <hi>Edmund Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who was at his Caſtle of <hi>Wigmore,</hi> he aſſembling the Country Forces, and joining Battle with them was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by them, himſelf being taken Priſoner, and then fettered, and caſt into a deep and vile Dungeon, from whence King <hi>Henry</hi> would not be perſuaded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him, but could rather have wiſhed both him and his two Siſters in Heaven, they being all three Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

            <p>Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> L. <hi>Cobham</hi> was born in this County, a valiant man, and a great Follower of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> for which he loſt his life; for this worthy Lord imbracing his Doctrines, and being a zealous defender both of them and the Profeſſors thereof, he thereby expoſed himſelf to the utmoſt fury and malice of his <hi>Popiſh</hi> adverſaries, and thereupon <hi>Arundel</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> called a Synod of the Clergy, who charged him with 246 Articles of Hereſy, and then made grievous complaints of him to K. <hi>Henry</hi> 5. who having patiently heard theſe blood-thirſty Wolves, deſired them that becauſe he was of Noble Blood, and was <hi>his Knight,</hi> they would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reduce him with gentleneſs, rather than rigor, promiſing alſo that himſelf would ſeriouſly diſcourſe with him concerning theſe matters; and accordingly ſent for the L. <hi>Cobham,</hi> adviſing him as an obedient Child to ſubmit himſelf to the Church, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his fault; To whom this Chriſtian Knight anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Moſt worthy Prince, I am always ready and willing to obey you, whom I know to be the Miniſter of God, bearing the Sword for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of thoſe that do well; unto you next to my eternal God, I owe all obedience, and ſubmit all I have to you, being ready to obey at all times whatever you ſhall in the Lord command me, but as for the Pope and his Spiritualty, I owe them neither ſute nor ſervice, knowing him by the Scriptures to be the Great Antichriſt, the Son of Perdition, the open Enemy to God, and the Abomination ſtanding in the Holy place;</hi> When the King heard this

bring him in alive or dead; But at laſt the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> either for love of the mony, or out of hatred to the True Chriſtian Religion, ſought divers ways to play the <hi>Judas,</hi> and at laſt obtained his purpoſe, apprehending him, and ſending him to <hi>London,</hi> where he was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drawn through the Streets, to the new Gallows in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s <hi>Fields,</hi> and there firſt hanged, and then burnt on the Gallows, and this was the end of this Godly Martyr of Jeſus Chriſt; and though the Papiſts charge him with Treaſon, yet we know it hath ever been the practice of the Devil and his Inſtruments to accuſe Gods Servants rather for Sedition than Religion, becauſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Princes are generally more careful of their own Honour, than Gods Glory; for thus they dealt with our Bleſſed Saviour, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who were accuſed for Diſloyalty, and ſtirring up Tumults; But the Almighty did not ſuffer his death to go unpuniſhed, for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop who ſate in Judgment upon him, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, was ſoon after ſtruck with a diſeaſe in his Tongue, that he could neither ſwallow any thing, nor ſpeak a word ſome days before his death, by which means he was ſtarved to death. <hi>Robert Devereux,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was born in this County in 1567. He was a Maſterpiece of Court and Camp, and came with many advantages to the Court of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loving his Perſon, ſent him once an angry loving Letter for going into <hi>France,</hi> often ſaying, <hi>We ſhall have this young Fellow knocked on the head, as fooliſh</hi> Sydney <hi>was, by his own forwardneſs,</hi> and was impatient till his return; after this upon ſome miſdemeanors he was brought to a private Tryal, wherein ſome words in his Letters were produced againſt him, as that, <hi>No ſtorm is more fierce than the indignation of an Impotent Prince, what, cannot Princes err? May they not injure their Subjects?</hi> Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved, he falling on his knees, profeſſed he would not conteſt with the Queen, nor excuſe the faults of his young years, proteſting that he alwaies meant well, and therewith ſhed ſo many tears as made the Spectators weep too; he was then cenſured, but the Queen ſoon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57811:57"/>

Mill, and privately buried him in a ground hard by; this Miller removed into another Country, and there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a long ſpace, till at laſt guided by the Providence of God for the manifeſtation of his Juſtice, he returned unto that place to viſit ſome of his Friends; while he was there, the Miller who now had the Mill, had occaſion to dig deep in that very place, where he found the Carkaſs of a man; this known, it pleaſed God to put it into their hearts to remember a Neighbour of theirs who 20 years before was ſuddenly miſſed, and ſince that time not heard of; and bethinking themſelves who was then Miller of that Mill, behold he was ready in Town, not having been there for many years before; this man was ſuſpected, &amp; thereupon examined, &amp; without much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do confeſſed the Fact, &amp; was accordingly executed for the ſame. In 1660. <hi>Sep.</hi> 3. near <hi>Worthington</hi> in this County there happened a dreadful Whirlwind which tore up a great Tree by the Roots, caſting it four or five yards from the place, rent off the great limbs of an Apple-Tree, and threw down a Houſe in the Street; the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was much ſhaken, and the Chancel in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; then it paſſed on with great force and noiſe to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> Hall, where it overturned five Bay of Barn-building, and a Gate-houſe, it blew down a ſtack of Chimnies, and hurried a man into the Garden, who by catching hold of a Tree ſtayed himſelf; at another Town, it rent a Houſe, where a woman and three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were miraculouſly preſerved, to which it brought a great Log of Wood, no body knew from whence; it carried away a Hive of Bees, and a load of Thorns, which could not be heard of, and turned up 20 Load of Wood by the roots; this whirlwind ran about three miles in length, and not above 20 yards in breadth, ſome ſaid there were flames of fire ſeen in it. Upon the 24. of <hi>January</hi> following, between ſix and ſeven a clock at night there was a very great Earthquake in moſt parts of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> which came at firſt like a noiſe in the Air at great diſtance, it ſhook the Houſes very much, and in ſome places men could hardly ſtand without holding;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57811:72"/>
the continuance thereof was about a quarter of an hour. Near <hi>Lutterworth</hi> is a ſpring ſo cold, that in a ſhort time it turneth ſtraw and ſticks into ſtone; <hi>John Wickliff</hi> was ſometime Parſon of <hi>Lutterworth</hi> Church, a man of ſingular and polite wit, and much converſant in the Scripture; his bones were afterward taken up and burnt by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Sir <hi>Robert Belknap,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas in K. <hi>Richard</hi> 2. time was of this County, and that K. having a deſign to deſtroy certain Lords, ſent for the Judges to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where the Kings many queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in fine reſolved into this, <hi>Whether he might by his Regal Power revoke what was acted in Parliament;</hi> to this all the Judges, Sir <hi>William Skipwith</hi> alone excepted, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Affirmatively, and ſubſcribed it, though this <hi>Belknap</hi> did it unwillingly, as foreſeeing the danger, and putting to his Seal, ſaid theſe words; <hi>There wants nothing now but an Hurdle, an Horſe, and an Halter to carry me where I may ſuffer the death I deſerve; for if I had not done this, I ſhould have dyed for it, and becauſe I have done it, I deſerve death for betraying the Lords.</hi> Yet it had been more for his credit to have adventured Martyrdom in defence of the Laws, than to hazard the death of a Malefactor in the breach thereof; but Judges are but men, and moſt men deſire to decline that danger which they think neareſt to them; but he and the other Judges were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for High-Treaſon in the next <hi>Wonder working Parliament,</hi> and hardly had eſcaped death, if the Queen had not earneſtly interceeded for them.</p>

Mounſon</hi> was extracted out of an Ancient Family in this Shire, and was from his Youth bred in Sea Service, wherein he attained to great perfection; Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> having cleared <hi>Ireland</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces, and deſiring carefully to prevent a Relapſe, altered the Scene of War from <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> from defending to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and Sir <hi>Richard Leviſon</hi> being Admiral, and <hi>Mounſon</hi> Vice Admiral, they in 1602. went to <hi>Portugal,</hi> where without drawing a Sword they quite killed Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on thoſe Coaſts, no Ships daring to go in or out of their Harbours; there they had Intelligence of a vaſt Carract ready to land in <hi>Siſimbria,</hi> which was of 1600 Tun, richly laden out of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> &amp; reſolved to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault it, though it ſeemed placed in an invincible poſture; of itſelf it was a Gyant in compariſon of our Pigmy Ships, and had in her 300 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentlemen; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>De Sancta Cruce</hi> lay hard by with 13 Ships, and all were ſecured under the Command of a ſtrong and well fortified Caſtle; but nothing is impoſſible to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, and Gods bleſſing thereon; After an hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, which laſted for ſome hours, with the Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Fire &amp; Sword, the Carract was conquered, the wealth taken therein amounting to the value of Ten Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Crowns of <hi>Portugal</hi> Account; But though the Goods gotten therein might be valued, the good gotten thereby was ineſtimable, for ever after the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> beheld the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with admiring Eyes, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the thoughts of <hi>Invaſion;</hi> this worthy Knight died a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the midſt of the Reign of King <hi>James.</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57811:74"/>
thence ſighs and groans, like thoſe of a man troubled in his ſleep, as if it felt ſome ſenſible torment; Many have climbed to the top thereof, where they heard the groans more plainly than they could below: One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt being atop, ſpoke to the Tree, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came down much aſtoniſhed, and lay groveling on the Earth Speechleſs for 3 hours, and then reviving ſaid,</q> 
               <hi>Brampton, Brampton,</hi> thou are much bound to pray: The Author of this News is one Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> a Miniſter, who was there preſent, and heard and ſaw theſe Paſſages, and told Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> of it: The Earl of <hi>Lincoln</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one of the Arms of the Aſh to be lopped off, and a hole to be bored into the Body, and then was the ſound or hollow voice heard more audibly than before, but in a kind of Speech which they could not comprehend nor underſtand.</p>
            <p>In 1666. <hi>Oct.</hi> 13. there was an extraordinary and dreadful Storm of Thunder in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Hailſtones much bigger than Pigeons, and ſome as large as Pullets Eggs; immediately after there followed a terrible ſtorm and Tempeſt, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a very unuſual noiſe, and with ſuch violence, that at <hi>Welborn</hi> it threw moſt of the Houſes to the ground, brake down ſome, and tore up other Trees by the Roots, ſcattering abroad much Corn and Hay, but by Divine Providence only one Boy was killed in that Town: It went thence to <hi>Willingore</hi> the next Town, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing ſome houſes, and killing 2 Children with the fall; it fell ſo violently on the Church of the next Town to this, that it preſently daſhed the Spire Steeple to pieces, and rent the Stone and Timberwork of the Church ſo violently, that but a little of the Wall, and only the Body of the Steeple was left ſtanding; it threw down many Houſes, Trees, and out-houſes in this Town, as well as in two others far diſtant: It was obſerved to move only in a channel or ſmall breadth, and if it had been conſiderably broader, could not but have ruined a great part of the Country; to ſome that ſaw it at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance before it came near them, it had the appearance
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57811:74"/>
of Fire, and was by ſome obſerved to move in a kind of circle, though at the ſame time it kept its general courſe along: It paſſed alſo through <hi>Nottinghamſhire;</hi> ſome of the Hailſtones being meaſured were 9 Inches about; this Whirl-Wind extended above 60 Yards in breadth; In the Forreſt of <hi>Sherwood</hi> it broke down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw at leaſt 1000 Trees, it brake one ſhort off in the Body which was three Foot in Diameter, it overthrew divers Wind Mills, ſome Boats in the River, and in one Town conſiſting of 50 Houſes it left but 7 ſtanding: The ſame Evening over <hi>Derby</hi> Town, and ſome other places, there appeared a fiery Sword hanging in the Air over them: The <hi>Thurſday</hi> after in the Evening there were ſtrange Fires ſeen hanging over <hi>Nottingham</hi> Town, ſinſomuch that ſome of the Inhabitants coming home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from a Country Market, thought the Town to be on Fire in three ſeveral places; theſe Informations, ſaith Mr. <hi>Clerk,</hi> I had from Eye-Witneſſes worthy of Credit.</p>
            <p>About <hi>April</hi> 26. 1661. at <hi>Spalding, Bourne,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other places in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> it rained Wheat, ſome grains whereof were very thin and hollow, but others of a more firm ſubſtance, and would grind into fine flower, ſeveral Pecks of it were taken up out of Church Leads, and other houſes that were leaded, ſeveral Inhabitants who were Eye-Witneſſes brought up a conſiderable quantity to <hi>London.</hi>

them as lying nearer than was conceived; on <hi>Eaſter</hi> day early in the morning both Armies are ordered for Battle; the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> appointed the command of his Right Wing, which conſiſted of Horſe to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Marqueſs <hi>Montacute,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Oxford;</hi> the left Wing likewiſe conſiſting of Horſe, was led by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the main Battle of Bills, and Bows was conducted by the Duke of <hi>Somerſet;</hi> on K. <hi>Edwards</hi> part the Van was commanded by <hi>Richard</hi> D. of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the main Battle (in which the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate K. <hi>Henry</hi> was Priſoner) was led by K. <hi>Edward</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the L. <hi>Haſtings</hi> brought up the Rear; after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations for incouraging their Souldiers, the fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, which with great valour was maintained for ſix hours without any apparent diſadvantage on either ſide, only <hi>Warwicks</hi> Van ſeemed by the courage of the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to overmatch King <hi>Edwards,</hi> which made ſome flying toward <hi>London</hi> carry the news, that the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> had won the Field, and ſo perhaps he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but for a ſtrange misfortune which happened to the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> and his men, for they having a Star with ſtreams on their Liveries, as K. <hi>Edwards</hi> men had the Sun, the Earl of <hi>Warwicks</hi> men by reaſon of the miſt, not well diſtinguiſhing the badges, ſhot at the Earl of <hi>Oxfords</hi> men, who were of their own ſide, whereupon the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> cryed out, <hi>Treaſon, Treaſon!</hi> and fled with 800 men; at length after great ſlaughter made on both ſides, K. <hi>Edward</hi> having the greater number of men, cauſed a new recruit of freſh Souldiers to come on, whom he had reſerved to that purpoſe, which the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> obſerving, being a man of an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage, nothing diſmayed, ruſhed into the midſt of his Enemies, where he adventured ſo far, that amongſt the preſs he was ſtruck down and ſlain; though ſome write, that ſeeing the deſperate condition of his Army, the Earl leapt on his Horſe to fly, and coming to a Wood where was no paſſage, one of K. <hi>Edwards</hi> men came to him and killed him, and ſtript him to his naked ſkin; The Marqueſs <hi>Montacute</hi> thinking to relieve his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>It is recorded that one chief occaſion of the <hi>Danes</hi> invading this Kingdom proceeded from the following Accident; About the year 867. one <hi>Lothbrook</hi> a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Royal Family of <hi>Denmark,</hi> being upon that Shoar, his Hawk in purſuing her Game, fell into the Sea, he to recover her, got into a ſmall Cockboat alone, and by a ſudden Tempeſt was driven with his Hawk to the Coaſt of <hi>Norfolk</hi> near <hi>Rodham,</hi> where being ſeized for a Spy, he was ſent to <hi>Edmund</hi> K. of the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> but having declared his birth and misfortune, the King took affection to him for his ſkill in Hawking, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good parts, and preferred him, but <hi>Berick</hi> the Kings Falconer envying this favour, as they were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together in a Wood, privately murdered him, and hid him in a Buſh; <hi>Lothbrook</hi> was ſoon miſſed, and by no inquiry could be found, till it pleaſed God his Dog, which would not forſake his dead Maſters Corps, came fawning to the King ſeveral times, and then went back to the wood, which the King obſerving, at length follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Hound, who brought him to the place where <hi>Lothbrook</hi> lay; and <hi>Berick</hi> being found guilty of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was ſentenced to be put into <hi>Lothbrooks</hi> Boat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tackle or Sail, as he arrived here; but behold the Event, the Boat returned to the ſame place in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> from whence it had been driven for <hi>Berick,</hi> as it were to be puniſhed for this Murther; here the Boat
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57811:79"/>
being known, <hi>Berick</hi> was taken, who to free himſelf from that bloody Fact, added Treaſon to Murther, affirming, <hi>That King</hi> Edmund <hi>had put</hi> Lothbrook <hi>to death in</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk; In revenge whereof, <hi>Inguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba</hi> the 2 Sons of the murdered <hi>Lothbrook,</hi> being made Generals of a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army arrived in <hi>England,</hi> and burnt up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſparing neither Sex, nor Age, and breaking into <hi>Norfolk,</hi> ſent this Meſſage to K. <hi>Edmund, That</hi> Inguar <hi>the moſt victorious Prince, dreadful both by Sea and Land, having brought divers Countries under his ſubjection, was now arrived in theſe parts, where he meant to winter, and requireth thee</hi> Edmund <hi>to be ſubject, and a vaſſal to him, to yield up to him thy hid Treaſures, and all other the riches of thine Anceſtors, and ſo to reign under him, which if thou refuſeſt to do, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judges thee unworthy both of life and Kingdom; Edmund</hi> hearing this proud Pagan Meſſage, after adviſing with his Council, returned this anſwer; <hi>Go</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and tell thy Lord, that</hi> Edmund <hi>the Chriſtian King for the love of a Temporal life will not ſubmit himſelf to a Pagan Duke, unleſs he will reſolve to become a Chriſtian;</hi> whereupon <hi>Inguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi> with their furious <hi>Danes,</hi> purſued the King to <hi>Thetford;</hi> who raiſing an Army, gave them Battle, but being overpowered by his Enemies, he retired to <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham</hi> Caſtle, where pitying the terrible ſlaughter of his People, he ſubmitted himſelf to the <hi>Danes,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not renounce the Chriſtian Religion, theſe bloody Heathens beat him with ſticks, and whipt him with rods; but he ſtill fervently calling upon the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they were ſo inraged, that binding him to a ſtake, they with their Arrows ſhot him to death, and cutting off his head, ſcornfully threw it into an hedg; But his body was afterward honourably buried at St. <hi>Edmundsbury,</hi> from whence that Town had its name.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Walſingham</hi> in this County there was a Chappel built in the year 1601. dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and renowned throughout <hi>England</hi> for a Pilgrimage to our <hi>Lady of Walſingham,</hi> and thoſe who did not viſit, and preſent her with offerings, were counted irreligious;

hear the deſcription of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> an Eye-witneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this place; <hi>About four miles from the Sea ſide,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſtandeth a Town that lives on nothing elſe almoſt but the reſort of Pilgrims to this place; there is a Colledge of Regular Canons, which hath ſcarce any other Revenues than from the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of this Virgin, for the greater oblations are preſerved, but the Mony and other Offerings of ſmaller value go to the maintenance of the Fryers; the Church is fair and neat, yet the Virgin dwells not therein, that honour</hi> (forſooth) <hi>ſhe hath done to her Son; ſhe hath her Church to her ſelf in the right hand of her Son; neither doth ſhe dwell there for all this, for the building is not yet finiſhed, ſmall light there was in it but by Tapers or Wax-Candles yielding a pleaſant ſmell; and when you come into it, you would ſay it were an heavenly habitation indeed, ſo bright ſhining all over it with precious Stones, and Gold and Silver.</hi> This Chappel with all the Trinkets therein, fell in the general deſtruction of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries by K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. At St. <hi>Bennet in the Holm,</hi> there was a great Abby built by <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo fortified by the Monks with Walls and Bulwarks, that it ſeemed rather a Caſtle than a Cloyſter, inſomuch that K. <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> could not win it by aſſault, till a Monk betrayed it into his hands, upon condition he himſelf ſhould be made Abbot thereof; which was done accordingly; but the King preſently hanged up this new Abbot for a Traitor, and ſo he was juſtly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for his Treachery. K. <hi>Stephen</hi> had only one Son named <hi>Euſtace,</hi> a Prince of much bloſſoming valour, as being cut off at 18 years of Age, ſome ſay by drowning, and others by a ſtranger Accident, but ſtrange Relations muſt not alwaies be rejected, for though many of them be forged, yet ſome no doubt are true; and who knows but it may be of this kind which ſome writers relate of this Prince, <hi>That being at the Abby of</hi> Bury <hi>in the Dioceſs of</hi> Norwich, <hi>and denyed ſome money he demanded, he preſently in a rage went forth, and ſet the Cornfields belonging to the Abby on fire, but afterward ſitting down to Dinner, at the firſt morſel of bread he put into his mouth, he fell into a fit of madneſs, and in that fit dyed;</hi> certainly the Perſons of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

            <p>In the 11th of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. there was ſo great an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and ſome other Counties, that it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew many who ſtood upon their feet, and made the Bells towl in the Steeples. In his 18th Year the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church at <hi>Norwich,</hi> with the Houſes thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, was burnt, and the Monks diſperſed. In the Reign of K. <hi>Richard</hi> 1. a Jew being turned Chriſtian at <hi>Lynn</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> he was perſecuted by thoſe of his own Nation, and aſſaulted in the ſtreet; who thereupon fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Church hard by, was followed thither alſo, and the Church aſſaulted, which the People of the Town ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in defence of the new Chriſtian they fell upon the Jews, of whom they ſlew a great number, and after pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged their Houſes; By this Example the Jews were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted in other places, and vaſt multitudes of them maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred, and ſome of them being blocked up in a Caſtle at <hi>York,</hi> cut the Throats of their Wives and Children and caſt them over the Walls on the Chriſtians Heads, and then burnt the Caſtle and themſelves; neither could this Sedition be ſtayed, till the King ſent his Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> with force of Arms to puniſh the offenders. In the 5th of <hi>Hen</hi> 5. a great part of the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> was burnt, and all the Houſes of the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Preachers, where two of the Friers themſelves were burnt in the flames.</p>
            <p>In the 2d of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. 1549 a dangerous Rebellion broke forth in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> about Grievances for <hi>Incloſures;</hi> The Rebels had got one <hi>Ket</hi> a Tanner to be their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who with others encouraged them to pull down In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, and in ſhort time they grew to a Body of 20000, ſo that the Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk</hi> commanding them in the Kings name to depart, or elſe he would proclaim them Traitors, he had been certainly ſlain, had not his Horſe been too ſwift for them; they furniſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Arms and Artillery, and for their better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity they fortified themſelves upon <hi>Monſhold</hi> hill, near
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57811:81"/>
St. <hi>Leonards</hi> hill by <hi>Norwich,</hi> where they carried a face as it were of Juſtice and Religion; for they had one <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> an Idle Fellow for their Chaplain, who morning and evening read ſolemn Prayers to them, alſo Sermons they had often; and as for Juſtice they ordained a Seat of Judgment in an old Tree, whoſe Canopy was the Cope of Heaven; in this Tree ſate the Tanner, as Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and chief Judge, giving out Warrants in the Kings name, and as his Deputy committed many Perſons of Quality to Priſon, he was aſſiſted by two choſen men of every hundred among them, from whom Commiſſions were ſent to bring in to them Powder, Shot, Victuals, and all things neceſſary, and here ſuch as had exceeded their Commiſſion were ordered to be impriſoned, ſo that this Tree was called, <hi>The Oak of Reformation,</hi> whence likewiſe ſome Sermons were delivered to the People, and once by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> which had like to have coſt him his Life; and now beginning to grow to a height, they preſented certain Complaints to the King, requiring he would ſend an Herald to give them ſatisfaction; the King, though he took it for a great Indignity to have ſuch baſe Fellows capitulate with him, yet framing himſelf to the time, he returned this anſwer; <hi>That in</hi> October <hi>following he would call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein their Complaints ſhould he heard, and all their Grievances redreſſed, requiring the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that the Marqueſs with his Forces not prevailing, the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was ſent with 6000 Foot, and 1500 Horſe, and many other Perſons of Quality; When the Earl approached the Camp of the Rebels, he ſent a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald offering them the Kings Pardon if they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, which they were ſo far from accepting, that a lewd Boy turned up his naked Breech toward the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, and bid him kiſs it; upon this many ſkirmiſhes paſſed between the Earl and them, with loſs ſometimes of one ſide, and ſometimes of another, at laſt they came to a Battle, where the Rebels placed in the Front all the Gentlemen they had taken Priſoners, deſigning they ſhould firſt be ſlain, of whom yet very few were hurt, but of the Rebels above 2000 were killed; and now once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> offered them pardon, but for all their loſſes they continued obſtinate; at laſt the Earl ſent to know if they would entertain their Pardon if he ſhould come in Perſon, and aſſure them of it; this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them much, and they anſwered, <hi>That they knew him to be ſo honourable, that from himſelf they would embrace it;</hi> whereupon he went to them, and cauſing their Pardon to be read again, he confirmed it by his words ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that they all caſt away their Arms, and with one voice cried, <hi>God ſave K.</hi> Edward: The day following <hi>Robert Ket</hi> the Tanner, and Arch-Rebel, was taken, and hanged in Chains upon the Caſtle of <hi>Norwich;</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Ket</hi> the younger, was hanged upon the high Steeple of <hi>Wimondham,</hi> and 9 of the other principal Rebels were hanged upon the <hi>Oak of Reformation;</hi> and thus ended the Sedition in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the day of the defeat of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels being a long time after obſerved as a Feſtival by the Citizens of <hi>Norwich,</hi> with no leſs joy than the Jews did when they eſcaped the ſword of wicked <hi>Haman.</hi>

great part thereof was lately burnt to Aſhes, though ſince for the moſt part nobly re-built; there are ſeven Pariſh Churches within the walls, whereof that of <hi>All-hallows</hi> is the chief; at <hi>Boughton</hi> there is a Spring which is conceived to turn Wood into Stone. <q>The truth is, ſaith Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> it doth incruſt any thing with Stone, but I have ſeen a Skull brought from thence to <hi>Sydney Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which was can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died over with Stone within and without, yet ſo as the bone remained entire in the middle, as by a breach made therein did appear; this Skull was ſent for by K. <hi>Charles,</hi> whil'ſt I was there to ſatisfy his own Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by him ſafely returned again to the Colledge.</q> The River <hi>Nen</hi> runs by the Southſide of <hi>Peterburrough,</hi> in the middle whereof is a gulf ſo deep, and cold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that even in Summer no Swimmer is able to dive to the bottom thereof, yet it is never frozen in Winter, for there is a Spring in it, whence the water always riſeth and bubleth up; and that keeps it from freezing.</p>

               <hi>Robert Braybrook,</hi> born at a Village in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> was conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> in the 4th of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. 1381. he was after Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> he died 1404. and was buried under a Marble Stone in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in the Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul, London,</hi> yet was the body of this Biſhop lately taken up, and found firm as to ſkin, hair, joints, nails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for upon that fierce and fatal Fire in <hi>London</hi> 1666. which turned ſo much of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> into rubbiſh, when part of the floor fell into St <hi>Faiths,</hi> this dead Perſon was ſhaken out of his Tomb, where he had lain, and ſlept ſo unchanged, as you have heard no leſs than 262 years. His body was for a great while expoſed to the view of all Perſons, many coming daily to ſee this ſtrange Curioſity. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Richard Noodvil,</hi> was born at <hi>Grafton</hi> in this County, ſhe was Widdow to Sir <hi>John Gray,</hi> who loſt his life for the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and petitioned K. <hi>Edward</hi> 4. to take off the ſequeſtration from her join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Beauty is a good Solliciter, where youth is to be the Judge; the King fell inamoured of her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

a Suitor to her for a nights lodging; and being importunate with her therein, ſhe modeſtly told him; <hi>That as ſhe did account her ſelf too mean to be his Wife, ſo ſhe thought her ſelf too worthy to be his Harlot;</hi> The King fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he could not prevail by wanton love, reſolves to marry her, though much to the diſcontent of his Council, and likewiſe of his Mother; who among other reaſons alledged, <hi>That her being a Widdow might be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to reſtrain him;</hi> to whom the King replied, <hi>Whereas you ſay, Madam, that ſhe is a Widdow, and hath already Children, by Gods bleſſed Lady I am a Batchellor, and have ſome too, and ſo each of us have a proof that none of us is like to be barren;</hi> and he accordingly married her, being the firſt of our Kings ſince the Conqueſt, that married his own Subject; yet was his love divided among three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Miſtreſſes, of whom he was wont to ſay; <hi>The one was the faireſt, the other the merrieſt, and the third the Holieſt Harlot in</hi> England, <hi>as being alwaies at her Beads in the Chappel, when he ſent for her to his Bed;</hi> His Queen lived to ſee the death of her Huſband, murther of her two Sons, reſtraint of her ſelf, and the reſt of her Children, ſo that ſhe had more greatneſs than joy, height than happineſs by Marriage; ſhe finiſhed <hi>Queens Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and died not long after.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Fotheringay Caſtle</hi> in this County, was acted the Tragedy of <hi>Mary</hi> Q. of <hi>Scots,</hi> Mother to K. <hi>James,</hi> in the 29 year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> 1587. This <hi>Mary</hi> was the Daughter, and only lawfully begotten Child of <hi>James</hi> 5. and ſucceeded in her Cradle to the Throne, ſhe was promiſed in Marriage to King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. of <hi>England,</hi> but by the power of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> carried into <hi>France,</hi> and there married to <hi>Francis</hi> 2.

was preſently bandying of the Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the Queen Dowager, and each of them ſent for Aid; ſhe from <hi>France,</hi> and the Lords from <hi>England;</hi> but this was matter for Conſultation; it ſeemed a bad example for a Prince to give Aid to the Rebellious Subjects of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Prince; on the other ſide it ſeemed no leſs than Impiety not to give Aid to Proteſtants of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but moſt of all it ſeemed meer madneſs to ſuffer enemies to be ſo near Neighbours, and let the <hi>French</hi> neſtle in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who pretend Title to <hi>England;</hi> upon ſuch conſiderations it was reſolved Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhould ſend them Aid, and thereupon an Army of 6000 Foot, and 1200 Horſe were ſent under the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and others, who going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> joined with the Lords, where paſſed many light Skirmiſhes, many Batteries, and ſometimes Aſſaults, which growing tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſoon after ended in a Peace between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> upon condition, <hi>That neither the King of</hi> France, <hi>nor the Queen of</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhould thence forth uſe the Arms or Titles of</hi> England <hi>or</hi> Ireland, <hi>and that both the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> French <hi>ſhould depart out of</hi> Scotland; <hi>and a general pardon ſhould paſs in Parliament for all that had been Actors in thoſe Stirs;</hi> The Peace was ſcarce concluded, when <hi>Francis</hi> the young K. of <hi>France</hi> died, and left <hi>Mary</hi> Qu. of <hi>Scots</hi> a Widdow; ſoon after the Houſe of Commons in Parliament humbly moved Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who anſwered, <hi>That ſhe was already Married to the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>and behold,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>the pledge of the Covenant with my Husband;</hi> and therewith held out her Finger, and ſhewed the Ring wherewith at her Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe gave her ſelf in Wedlock to the Kingdom, <hi>and if,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I keep my ſelf to this Husband, and take no other, yet I doubt not but God will ſend you as good Kings as if they were born of me, for as much as we ſee by dayly experience that the iſſue of the beſt Princes do often degenerate, and for my ſelf it will be ſufficient that a Marble Stone declare, that a Queen having reigned ſuch a time, lived and dyed a Virgin.</hi> She had indeed many matches propounded to her, to whom ſhe gave Teſtimonies of her Princely favour, but never
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57811:84"/>
pledges of nuptial Love; about this time the Earl of <hi>Feria,</hi> who had Married the Daughter of Sir <hi>William Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> being denied leave of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for ſome of his Wives Friends to live in <hi>England,</hi> he grew ſo inraged, that he perſuaded Pope <hi>Pius</hi> 4. to Excommunicate her as an Heretick and Uſurper; but the Pope pretending to great gentleneſs, writ to her lovingly, <hi>To return to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Catholick Church;</hi> and made great offers, if ſhe would hearken to his Counſel, particularly, <hi>That he would recall the Sentence againſt her Mothers Marriage, confirm the Book of Common-Prayer in Engliſh, and permit the uſe of the Sacrament in both kinds,</hi> but the Queen neither terrified with <hi>Feria</hi>'s practices, nor allured with the Popes great offers; according to her Motto, <hi>Semper eadem, always the ſame,</hi> perſiſted conſtant in her reſolution to maintain that Religion which in her Conſcience ſhe was perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be moſt agreeable to the Word of God, and the practice of the Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> after the death of her Huſband went from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then ſent Letters to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> offering readily to enter into a League with her, ſo ſhe might by Authority of Parliament be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her Succeſſor, which was but her Right; to which Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> anſwered, <hi>That though ſhe would no way dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from her Right, yet ſhe ſhould be loth to endanger her own ſecurity, and as it were to cover her own eyes with a grave cloth while ſhe was alive;</hi> The two Queens were indeed both of great Spirits, <hi>Mary</hi> doubting Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> meant to fruſtrate her Succeſſion; and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> leſt the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> meant to hinder her Succeſſion, which created Jealouſies, and many unkind paſſages between them, as by the ſequel appears. The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> having a deſire to Marry again, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> to her, but ſhe Married the Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and thereupon the next Parliament again move Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to marry, to declare her Succeſſor to the Crown, ſome of them boldly arguing, <hi>That Princes were bound to deſign a Succeſſor, and that in not doing it, the Queen would ſhew her
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57811:85"/>
ſelf no better than a Parricide, and deſtroyer of her Country:</hi> The Queen was contented to bear with words ſpoken in Parliament, which out of it ſhe would never have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and commanded 30 of each Houſe to appear before her, to whom ſhe ſaid, <hi>That ſhe knew what danger hangeth over a Princes head, when a Succeſſor is once decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſhe knew that even Children themſelves, out of a haſty deſire of bearing Rule, had taken up Arms againſt their own Father, and how could better be expected from Kindred? And therefore though ſhe had given them leave to debate the matter of Succeſſion, ſhe bid them beware not to be injurious to their Princes patience;</hi> After which they never made any further motion to her; but now the love between the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> began to cool, and their unkindneſs was fomented by one <hi>David Riſio</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Muſician, and afterward the Queens Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who had often ſecret conference with her, when the King might not be admitted; this indignity the Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the King made him ſenſible of, and thereupon his death was contrived, and he was killed in an outer Chamber next the Queen, ſhe being then with Child, and like by the affright to have miſcarried; the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> baſe Son to K. <hi>James</hi> 5. and baſe Brother to the Queen, was the chief inſtigator of this murther, of the foulneſs of which Fact when the King was ſenſible, he reſolved to be revenged upon <hi>Murray,</hi> who having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof prevented it, with cauſing the like to be done to him, for ſoon after the King in a ſtormy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous night was ſtrangled in his Bed, and then caſt forth into the Garden, and the Houſe immediately blown up with Gunpowder; the rumor of this murther being ſpread abroad common fame laid it upon <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> and their Confederates; <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> lay it upon the Queen; the King thus murthered, the Queen was adviſed by them to Marry <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwell</hi> (though he was the man that had acted the Murther) but upon condition that above all things reſpect might be had to her young Son; and that <hi>Bothwell</hi> might be legally quitted both from the bonds of his former Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57811:85"/>
and alſo of the Kings Murther; hereupon it is plotted that <hi>Bothwell</hi> ſhould be brought to the Bar, and <hi>Morton</hi> being his advocate, by the ſentence of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, he is clearly acquitted; and then by conſent of ſome of the Nobility he is Married to the Queen, being firſt made Duke of <hi>Orkney;</hi> which bred a ſuſpition in many, that the Queen was conſcious of the Murther, which was the thing the Confederates aimed at by this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for they by all means increaſed the ſuſpition, that they might have the better colour againſt her, and ſo the very ſame men who abſolved <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Marriage, now take arms againſt her, as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent in both, forcing her Huſband to flee, and then ſeize upon the Queen, whom clad in a very homely garment, they thruſt into Priſon in <hi>Lochlevyn;</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hearing of it, ſends Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> to expoſtulate the matter with them, who alledged <hi>The Queen was ſubject to no Tribunal under Heaven; That no Judge on Earth might call her in queſtion,</hi> &amp;c. They again oppoſed the peculiar right of that Kingdom, and uſed <hi>Buchanans</hi> argument in his Treaſonable Dialogue, <hi>That in extraordinary Caſes the People have power both to create, and to depoſe their King;</hi> They then perſuaded her to reſign the Kingdom, which if ſhe refuſed to do fairly, they threatned to queſtion her openly for her inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent living, for the Kings Murther, &amp; for Tyranny, ſo that through fear She reſigned her Kingdom to her young Son <hi>James</hi> at that time ſcarce thirteen months old, who was five days after anointed and Crowned King; and ſhe conſtituted <hi>Murray</hi> Vice-Roy during his Minority; ſoon after ſome of <hi>Bothwells</hi> Servants were executed for the Kings Murther; who cleared the Queen from being concerned in it.</p>
            <p>The Queen having been 11 Months Priſoner, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made her eſcape, and raiſed Forces, which being unexperienced were ſoon defeated by <hi>Murray;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe endeavoured to ſave her ſelf by flight, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled 60 Miles in one day, and contrary to the advice of her Friends went with a few of her Attendants in a

                  </gap>lmain</hi> refuſed the confederacy, or to take the Oath without his Fathers conſent, they boldly told him, <hi>That if his Father himſelf did not hold with the Baronage of</hi> England, <hi>he ſhould not have a furrow of Earth among them;</hi> Theſe hot proceedings made all the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> about the King run from <hi>Oxford</hi> into <hi>France;</hi> yea <hi>Richard</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Kings Brother, coming to ſee the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the Barons grew ſuſpicious of him, and therefore required him to take the following Oath: <hi>Hear all men,</hi> I Richard <hi>E. of</hi> Cornwall <hi>ſwear upon the holy Goſpels to be faithful and forward to reform with you the Kingdom of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>hitherto by the counſel of wicked men too much deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I will be an effectual coadjutor to expel the Rebels and Troublers of the Realm from out of the ſame: This Oath will I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon pain to forfeit all the Lands I have in</hi> England. Theſe proceedings were too hot to hold; for a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> two of the chiefeſt Confederates, falling at debate among themſelves, the King took the advantage thereof, and in a little time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his former Power and Authority: But from hence we may obſerve that the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Nobility, Clergy nor Laity, have not at all times been ſo very Loyal to their Princes, as they would now make the ignorant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. In the 20.

            <p>In 1400. a Conſpiracy was contrived againſt K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. in the firſt Year of his Reign, in the houſe of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who was a kind of a Book-Stateſman, but better read in the Politicks of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> than <hi>Solomon,</hi> who remembring ſome words of K. <hi>Henry</hi> when he was
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57811:95"/>
only Earl of <hi>Derby; That Princes had too little and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men too much;</hi> and fearing leſt now being King he ſhould put his words into Act, he thought it better to uſe preventing Phyſick before hand, than to ſtand to the hazard of curing it afterward; and thereupon invited to his Houſe ſeveral diſcontented Lords, as the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Aumerle</hi> E. of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> E. of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carlile, Maudlin,</hi> one of K. <hi>Richard</hi> 2. Chaplains, and ſeveral other Knights and Gentlemen, who after Dinner conferring together, and communicating their diſaffections to each other againſt K. <hi>Henry;</hi> they reſolved at laſt to take away his Life, and contrived this way to do it; They would publiſh a ſolemn Juſts or Turnament to be held at <hi>Oxford</hi> at a day appointed, to which the King was to be invited to honour it with his preſence, and there while all men were intent upon the ſport, they would have him mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.

            <p>Little <hi>Jeffery</hi> was born in the Pariſh of <hi>Oakham,</hi> his Father was a very proper man, broad ſhouldred, and cheſted, though his Son never arrived at a full Ell in Stature; his Father who kept and ordered the baiting of Bulls for <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> a place requiring a ſtrong body to manage it, preſented him at <hi>Burleigh in the Hill</hi> to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> being then nine years old, and ſcarce a foot and half in height, upon which <hi>Jeffery</hi> was inſtantly heightned, not in ſtature, but condition, from one degree above Raggs into Silk and Sattin, and had two tall men to attend him; he was without any deformity, wholly proportionable, whereas Dwarfs are often Pigmies in one part, and Giants in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet though he was the leaſt that <hi>England</hi> ever ſaw, he was a proper Perſon, compared to him that <hi>Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaies was ſeen in <hi>Italy,</hi> who was a man of a ripe Age, not above a Cubit high, and was carried about in a Parrots Cage; this <hi>Jeffery</hi> was once preſented in a cold baked Pye to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> at an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and ever after lived in great plenty at Court, wanting nothing but Humility, having a high mind in a low body, which made him that he did not <hi>know himſelf,</hi> and would not <hi>know his Father,</hi> for which by the Kings Command he was ſeverely corrected; He was though a Dwarf no Coward, being a Captain of Horſe in the Kings Army in the late Civil Wars, and afterward went over to follow the Queen in <hi>France,</hi> where being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:57811:105"/>In the 35th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1591. there was a great Tempeſt in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> whereby the ſhaft of the Steeple in <hi>Stafford</hi> Town was rent in pieces all along through the middle, and thrown upon the Church, wherewith the roof was ſo ſhattered, that a 1000 pound would not repair it; Many Houſes and Barns were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in divers places in that Shire; In <hi>Cauck Wood</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 3000 Trees were blown down, and likewiſe more than 50 Steeples; ſoon after there was a ſtrong North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and a very great rain which continued 24 hours.

               <hi>Act of Attainder,</hi> whereby he was condemned before he was heard, and the King not long after his death repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his haſt, wiſhing <hi>That he had his</hi> Cromwell <hi>alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</hi> When he came upon the Scaffold at <hi>Towerhill,</hi> he ſpake thus to the People; <hi>I am come hither to die, and not to purge my ſelf as ſome perhaps may expect I ſhould; I am by the Law condemned to dye, and I thank my Lord that hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me this death for mine offences, for I have alwaies lived a Sinner, and offended my Lord God, for which I ask him hearty forgiveneſs; It is not unknown to many of you that I was a great Traveller, and being but of mean Parentage was called to high Eſtate, and now I have offended my Prince, for which I heartily ask him forgiveneſs, beſeeching you to pray with me to Almighty God that he will forgive me, And once again I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to pray for me, that ſo long as life remaineth in this fleſh, I may waver nothing in my Faith;</hi> Then kneeling down on his knees, he made an excellent Prayer, concluding thus. <hi>Grant O moſt merciful Father that when death ſhall ſhut up the Eyes of my Body, yet the Eyes of my Soul may ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and look upon thee, and when death hath taken away the uſe of my Tongue, yet my heart may cry and ſay unto thee, Lord into thy hands I commend my ſoul, Lord Jeſus receive my ſoul,</hi> Amen.

the confidence to kill <hi>Zouch Allen,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice with his own hands upon the Bench in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> ſo much did he preſume upon his great favour with the King. In the Barons Wars with this King, the Lords got into this Caſtle of <hi>Lewes,</hi> and not far off fought a great Battle wherein the King had his Horſe ſhot under him, and was taken Priſoner with his Brother and Son.</p>
            <p>In the year 1058. <hi>Harold</hi> putting to Sea in a ſmall Boat for his pleaſure from <hi>Boſeham</hi> his Mannor in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and having unſkilful Marriners, was driven upon the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy,</hi> where by Duke <hi>William</hi> he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till he had ſworn to make him King of <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Conſeſſor</hi> died without Children; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward without any regard to his Oath he placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Throne. Duke <hi>William</hi> hereupon arrived at <hi>Pemſey,</hi> and with his Sword revenged the Perjury of <hi>Harold</hi> at <hi>Battle</hi> in this County with ſuch ſeverity, that there fell 67974 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men that day, the Conqueror putting himſelf thereby into full poſſeſſion of the whole Kingdom; over which he Reigned 22 years, being victorious both at home and abroad; but to diſcover the vanity of all earthly things, it ſometimes happens, that ſome great Perſons are not ſuffered to go to reſt when their Bed is made, and others are pulled out of thoſe Lodgings whereof they had once taken peaceable poſſeſſion; as appears very fully in the following Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the ſoul of this victorious Prince, <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> left his Body, but that his dead Corps was abandoned by his Nobles and Followers, and by his meaner Servants he was ſtript of Armour, Veſſels, Apparel, and all Princely Furniture, his naked Body left upon the floor, and his Funerals wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, till one <hi>Harlwin</hi> a poor Country Knight under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to carry his Corps to St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Church at <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which the dead King had formerly founded; At his entrance into <hi>Caen,</hi> the Covent of Monks came forth to meet him, but at the ſame inſtant there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great Fire, ſo that as his Corps before, ſo now his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57811:111"/>
Hearſe was forſaken of all men, every one running to quench the Fire; That done, they return and carry the Corps to the Church; The Funeral Sermon being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the ſtone Coffin ſet in the Earth in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, as the body was ready to he laid therein, there ſtood up one <hi>Anſelm,</hi> and forbid the Burial, alledging, that that very place was the floor of his Fathers Houſe, which this dead King had violently taken from him to build this Church upon, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaid he, I <hi>challenge this ground, and in the name of God forbid, that the Body of this Oppreſſor and diſpoyler be covered with the Earth of mine Inheritance;;</hi> They were therefore forced to compound with him for an hundred pounds; now was the body to be laid in that ſtone Coffin, but the Tomb proved too little for the Corps, ſo that preſſing it down to gain an entrance, the Belly not bowelled, brake, and ſent forth ſuch an intolerable ſtink among the Aſſiſtants at the Funeral, that all the Gums and Spices ſuming in their Cenſers could not relieve them, but all in great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haſtened away, leaving only a Monk or two to ſhuffle up the Burial, which they performed with all poſſible haſt, and ſo got to their Cells; yet was not this the laſt of thoſe Troubles that the Corps of this great Prince met with, but ſome years after at ſuch time as <hi>Caen</hi> was taken by the <hi>French,</hi> his Tomb was rifled, his bones thrown out, and ſome of them by private Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers brought as far as <hi>England</hi> again, ſo that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his many troubles in life, and after his death, we may well think that notwithſtanding all his greatneſs, a very mean man could hardly be perſuaded to change Fortunes with him.

            <p>In the 19th of King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. 1235. there was a great dearth in <hi>Eng.</hi> ſo that many poor people died for want of food, the Rich being ſo cruelly covetous as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them; and among others <hi>Walter Gray</hi> A.

               <p>It is recorded that <hi>Sergius</hi> K. of <hi>Scots,</hi> was ſo addicted to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, that he neglected his own Wife, and drove her to ſuch pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that ſhe was forced to wait upon another Noblewoman for her living, whereupon watching her opportunity, ſhe ſlew her Husband in Bed, and her ſelf after.

                  <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> was a very magnificent and couragious Prince in 1067. of which he gave proof in the beginning of his Reign, for being informed of a Conſpiracy againſt his life, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the knowing of it, till being abroad one day a hunting, he took one of the chief Conſpirators aſide, challenged him as a Traitor, adding; <hi>Here now is a fit place to do that manfully, which you intended to perform by Treachery; now if you have any valour, kill me honourably, and none being preſent you can incur no danger.</hi> With this Speech of the King, the man was ſo daunted, that he fell at his Feet, confeſſed his fault, asked forgiveneſs, and proved ever after Faithful and Loyal. This King repealed that barbarous Statute of K. <hi>Eugenius</hi> 3 by the perſuaſion of his Virtuous Lady <hi>Margret,</hi> Siſter to K. <hi>Edward Atheling,</hi> which ordained, <hi>That when a man was married, his Lord should lye with his Bride the firſt night;</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it to be redeemed with half a Mark of Silver, which ſum is to this day put into the Leaſes which the Lords make to their Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals; this King beſieging <hi>Aldwich</hi> Caſtle, an <hi>English</hi> Knight unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, only with a light Spear in his hand, on the end of which he carried the Keys of the Caſtle, came riding into the Camp, where being brought to the King, and bowing his Spear, as though he intended to preſent him with the Keys, ran him into the left Eye, and left him for dead, and by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe eſcaped; hence ſome ſay came the great Family of the <hi>Pierceys;</hi> His Queen hearing of her Husband and Sons death, beſeeched the Almighty that ſhe might not ſurvive them, and had her deſire, dying within a days after.</p>
